Instructions for Assignment1 - ListBoxer
========================================
Find the maximum number of errors intentionally made in the ListBoxer program.
A full description of the principle of the program is available through the "Help" menu, after its launch.

For testing, you can use either ListBoxerFull.zip or ListBoxerShort.zip

* ListBoxerFull.zip (with run-time Visual Basic libraries)
* ListBoxerShort.zip (without Run-time Visual Basic libraries)

The number and non-obviousness of the errors found will influence the assessment of your result: write everything you find.

The program includes both errors that lie on the surface, and requiring careful and in-depth testing.

Based on the results of the search for errors in the program, you need to compile a report, according to the template.
